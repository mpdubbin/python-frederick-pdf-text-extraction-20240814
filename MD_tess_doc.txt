Michael Dubbin was born in the year 980 AD in the village of Fjordheim, nestled along the 
rugged coastline of Norway. From a young age, Michael showed a fierce determination and thirst 
for adventure that would one day make him a legendary Viking warrior. As a boy, Michael spent 
his days learning the ways of the sea from his father, a skilled shipbuilder and navigator. He 
listened intently as his father regaled him with tales of epic voyages to distant lands, the roar of 
the ocean, and the thrill of battle. Michael's heart raced with excitement, and he knew his destiny 
lay beyond the fjords of his homeland.  
Becoming a Viking Warrior 
When Michael came of age, he eagerly joined the crew of a Viking longship, eager to prove his 
worth and earn a place among the fearsome raiders. He quickly distinguished himself through his

navigating treacherous waters. He participated in numerous raids, plundering the wealth of 
foreign lands and returning home with treasures to share with his village.

mysterious lands of the west. With a crew of the bravest Vikings, Michael set sail across the 
uncharted waters of the North Atlantic, braving fierce storms and treacherous currents. After 
weeks of grueling travel, Michael's longship finally reached the shores of a vast, unknown 
continent. The Vikings were the first Europeans to set foot on the land that would one day be 
known as North America, and Michael Dubbin's name would be etched into the annals of 
history.
